In the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the NLU's are, "a small number of dynamic and outstanding law schools" in the country, which "remain islands of excellence amidst a sea of institutionalised mediocrity." It all began with the establishment of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) in Bangalore in 1987 which experimented with a highly rigorous five year BA.LLB model, where students fresh out of high school were subjected to an intensive training programme that combined theory and practice and mandated continuous evaluation and copious amounts of legal writing and research. They were also encouraged to participate widely in co-curricular and extra curricular activities such as moot courts. It was hoped that at the end of the training, these freshly minted graduates would go on to take their rightful place as social engineers. Since the establishment of NLSIU, 14 other NLU's have cropped up over the years in different states. Similarly, prestigious law schools have opened up in all parts of India and are dedicated towards imparting world-class legal education.`

Little wonder then that many of the leading law schools have near perfect placement statistics and their graduate earn some of the highest entry level salaries, competing with the best from the IIT's and IIM's. Top graduates from the top NLU's can earn as much as Rs.15 lakh per annum soon after graduation. Of course, not all graduates opt for such high paying jobs at law firms and corporate houses. Some prefer to join NGO's and leverage their legal skills to bring about social change in areas such as human rights and environmental protection. Others join international organisations such as the UN, World Bank and the WTO with a view to contributing towards world peace, conflict resolution and a more efficient framework for international trade. Yet others go on to pursue careers in research, teaching and policy advocacy, often after completing higher studies (LLM) from globally reputed institutions; a career choice made more feasible now, thanks to the fifth pay commission pay outs.
